State Design Pattern:-
1. This design pattern is mostly used when the state of the system changes and each state has only some defined actions.
2. we will have a client class which will have the state instance, we will also have methods to set and get states.
3. we will have class for each state that extends an abstract class and these state will have the implementations of the actions.
